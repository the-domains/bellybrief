  As a millennial, the journey into motherhood is full of new challenges
  previous generations may not relate to. While we live in the age of
  information where it’s easy to overcome the unknown by searching the almighty
  Google, there's also a lot of stuff and noise to sift through. What’s
  relevant? What’s the real deal? Where to start? What to ask? It's confusing.
  We know. That’s why we’re here to make it easier to know what's up and be a
  more well-informed mom. You're welcome.

As a millennial, the journey into motherhood is full of new challenges previous generations may not relate to. While we live in the age of information where it's easy to overcome the unknown by searching the almighty Google, there's also a lot of stuff and noise to sift through. What's relevant? What's the real deal? Where to start? What to ask? It's confusing. We know. That's why we're here to make it easier to know what's up and be a more well-informed mom. You're welcome.
